        story= _ "Mysterious beasts have captured Mehir and Jaffar deep inside the jungle. After few hours of flight they landed in a very distant place just in front of a small lizard wearing an ornamental feather headdress . It turned out that he was a leader of all forest creatures, called 'The Keeper'. After listening Rhaxiz's report, the lizard whom Mehir had helped, the lord of the forest started up a conversation with the captured Summoners, during which Mehir and Jaffar got to know why they were brought here." 
    [/part]
    [part]
        story= _ "From time immemorial, on the distant south, a race of intelligent lizards called the 'Darkblooded' protected their lands from the barbarian hordes that arise from the local wastelands. The Jungle of Life that summoners have entered is the home of the Darkblooded, as much the Great Desert is to the Summoners. This unusual tropical land is a holy place for its dwellers, to be protected at all costs. When the Summoners have contacted the lizards, they had thought that they were barbarians because of their similar language. Despite that, Rhaxiz hadn't attacked because Mehir explained he is not from the east, where enemy lives, but from the north. Nevertheless the appearance of a 'fiery demon' scared the lizards so much that they had thrown themselves on the Summoners, thinking that they wanted to burn their holy forest. Although Rhaxiz had withdrawn to defend the Jungle in other places, Summoners had still been observed."
    [/part]
    [part]
        story= _ "Despite Mehir's later help, the Darkblooded have been angry with the Summoners. They say that in the construction of the 'devil's path' a part of their forest was destroyed and they can't forgive it, especially because each tree is holy for them, and the newcomers from the north cut down many of them. Jaffar and Mehir explained as best as they could who they are and why the construction of the circle is so important for all of the Summoners. The Darkblooded couldn't understand some words, but it didn't matter. The Keeper decided to set them free, but in the same breath he threatened the Summoners with immediate death if they would so much as cut the grass.
However, hope remained."
    [/part]
    [part]
        story= _ "As soon as Mehir and Jaffar were loaded on wyverns, Rhaxiz reminded the Keeper about some lizards that were captured a few days ago by barbarians. He also described how good the Summoners are fighting in the desert. The Keeper agreed at once and ordered for the Summoners to be brought back. A Darkblooded ordered Mehir (as he was more trustworthy) to set out to the Fire Canyon to rescue those lizards. They promised him that if all captured lizards will be returned in one piece, the Summoners will be given a permission to continue their work in the Darkblooded's territory. At the same time Jaffar and his massive chest of gold were held hostage, against the lizards' well being."
    [/part]
    [part]
        story= _ "After being released, Mehir immediately set out to Sud-Affar and informed Sharif about the whole situation. The leader of the city wasn't really happy about the Keeper's idea of sending Mehir to such an important mission but he had no choice. Mehir set out immediately."
